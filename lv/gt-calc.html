            <p>
                Once we have eliminated dominated strategies for each player, it often
                turns out that a pure strategy that was not dominated at the outset is now
                dominated. Thus, we can undertake a second round of eliminating dominated
                strategies. Indeed, this can be repeated until pure strategies are no
                longer eliminated in this manner. In a finite game, this will occur after a
                finite number of rounds and will always leave at least one pure strategy remaining
                for each player. If strongly (resp. weakly) dominated strategies are
                eliminated, we call this the iterated elimination of strongly dominated strategies.

            <h3>Nash equilibrium</h3>
            <p>
                In game theory, the Nash equilibrium, named after American mathematician John Forbes Nash Jr., is a solution concept of a non-cooperative game involving two or more players in which each player is assumed to know the equilibrium strategies of the other players, and no player has anything to gain by changing only his own strategy. If each player has chosen a strategy and no player can benefit by changing strategies while the other players keep theirs unchanged, then the current set of strategy choices and the corresponding payoffs constitutes a Nash equilibrium.
